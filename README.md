# PersonalWebTool_V1.2

First substancial project I made in VS with C#,  MVC pattern. It had a simple authorization (hashed password saved in code) for admin area. It contains CRUD methods.
It has publicly accesible blog with categories filtering and privately accesible: <br/>
-blog editor -> simple custom cms<br/>
-blog categories editor -> CRUD<br/>
-gratefullness diary -> CRUD<br/>
-habits tracker -> creating habits to which you assign points and sum is calculated for each day.<br/>
<br/>
Data is stored in SQL with Entity Framework.<br/>
