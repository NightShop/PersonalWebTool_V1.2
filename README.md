# PersonalWebTool_V1.2

First substancial project I made in VS with C#,  MVC pattern. It had a simple authorization (hashed password saved in code) for admin area. It contains CRUD methods.
It has publicly accesible blog with categories filtering and privately accesible:
-blog editor -> simple custom cms
-blog categories editor -> CRUD
-gratefullness diary -> CRUD
-habits tracker -> creating habits to which you assign points and sum is calculated for each day.

Data is stored in SQL with Entity Framework.
